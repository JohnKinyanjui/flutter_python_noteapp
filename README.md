This is a simple note app which uses python server for storing notes which is really cool.
So to use this project you will first need to have flutter,python and also some requiremets like pip to use it.
The project files contain a certain folder called Backend this is where the python server code is located.

For those who are completely new to this kinda of stuff you can try to use or test the python code.
You can first try to run the python code alone.

1.So first download the whole project to your computer.

2.You can move to separate the **Backend folder** to another place to avoid any confusion.It does not need to be in the flutter app folder.

3.Download **Visual studio code** or another program then in the terminal you can type this to run code **python main.py** and for python 3 users you can write **python3 main.py**


If you receive any error you will need to install the libraries involved and thats actually easy first make sure you have pip installed and you can look inthe code and see which libraries used:
**for example** :write this in you terminal or command prompt **pip install flask**, **pip install flask_sqlalchelmy** etc

**NB** **You can try to delete the** ***sqlite file*** and run the project again and see what happens
